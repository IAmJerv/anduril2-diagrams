# Anduril 2 UI Diagrams
User Interface digrams for Anduril 2 - an advanced flashlight UI developed by [ToyKeeper](https://github.com/ToyKeeper)

## Background
This was 100% inspired by [Lux-Perpetua’s Andúril 2 UI diagram on BLF](https://budgetlightforum.com/node/76941). In fact, Lux’s diagram is so good, that I would have been happy to just use it except for one thing: the source isn’t published, so you can’t modify it. I also wanted to be able to keep it up to date with [ToyKeeper’s code](https://github.com/ToyKeeper/anduril), so I created my own. I originally developed my diagrams in Microsoft Visio, and released the source file for folks to use and modify as they saw fit. However, folks were quick to point out that Visio is not open source, and not everyone has access to it. After some nudging by a colleague, I converted the diagrams to [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) which is multi-platform and open source. 

## Usage
The diagrams follow ToyKeeper's Anduril 2 releases, and will be updated any time there is a change to the Advanced or Simple UI's. Please note that these diagrams are *not* manufacturer and/or model specific, but rather follow the "vanilla" Anduril 2 releases with no modifications. The source SVG files are provided so that users and manufacturers can make thier own modifications per their configurations and preferences directly in Inkscape. I also export PNG and PDF versions of the diagrams. I *may* make vendor-specific diagrams in the futre; however, this is something that I do in my (very little) free time as a hobby.

## Credits
- The diagrams use the [Carlito font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Carlito) which is released under the [Open Font License](https://openfontlicense.org/).
- *Some* of the icons used in the diagrams came from [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/) under [various licenses](https://www.svgrepo.com/page/licensing/).
- The quality of the diagrams is *significantly* improved by the proofreading and creative input of [lowprofile](https://lemmy.world/u/lowprofile).
